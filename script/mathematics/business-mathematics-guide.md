## Basic Arithmetic for Business

Before diving into business math, let's review the fundamental operations you'll use daily.

### The Four Basic Operations

**Addition (+)**: Combining numbers
```
Example: Total revenue from three products
$500 + $750 + $1,200 = $2,450
```

**Subtraction (−)**: Finding the difference
```
Example: Calculating profit
Revenue $10,000 - Costs $6,500 = Profit $3,500
```

**Multiplication (×)**: Repeated addition
```
Example: Total cost for 50 units at $25 each
50 × $25 = $1,250
```

**Division (÷)**: Splitting into equal parts
```
Example: Cost per unit if 100 units cost $5,000
$5,000 ÷ 100 = $50 per unit
```

### Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)

When multiple operations appear together, follow this order:
1. **P**arentheses/Brackets first
2. **E**xponents/Orders (powers)
3. **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (left to right)
4. **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (left to right)

**Example**: Calculate total cost with discount
```
Problem: 10 items at $50 each, minus 20% discount
Wrong: 10 × $50 - 20% = $500 - 20% (ambiguous)
Right: (10 × $50) × (1 - 0.20) = $500 × 0.80 = $400
```

### Fractions in Business

**Fraction**: Part of a whole (numerator/denominator)

**Example**: If 3 out of 5 customers buy:
- Fraction: 3/5
- Decimal: 0.6
- Percentage: 60%

**Converting Fractions to Decimals**:
Divide the top by the bottom: 3 ÷ 5 = 0.6

**Converting Decimals to Percentages**:
Multiply by 100: 0.6 × 100 = 60%

**Adding Fractions** (need common denominator):
```
Example: Combining market shares of 1/4 and 1/3
Step 1: Find common denominator (12)
Step 2: 1/4 = 3/12 and 1/3 = 4/12
Step 3: 3/12 + 4/12 = 7/12
Result: 7/12 or about 58% combined market share
```

### Decimals and Rounding

**Rounding Rules**:
- If next digit is 5 or more → round up
- If next digit is 4 or less → round down

**Examples**:
- $45.67 rounded to nearest dollar = $46
- $45.32 rounded to nearest dollar = $45
- $45.50 rounds to $46 (round up on 5)

**Business Context**:
```
Revenue: $12,847.63
Rounded to nearest hundred: $12,800
Rounded to nearest thousand: $13,000
```

### Working with Negative Numbers

In business, negative numbers represent:
- Losses (negative profit)
- Debt (negative cash)
- Below-target performance

**Rules**:
- Negative × Negative = Positive: (−5) × (−2) = 10
- Negative × Positive = Negative: (−5) × 2 = −10
- Adding negative = Subtracting: 10 + (−3) = 7

**Example**: Monthly cash flow
```
Month 1: +$5,000 (profit)
Month 2: −$2,000 (loss)
Total: $5,000 + (−$2,000) = $3,000
```

---

## Percentages and Ratios

Percentages are everywhere in business. Mastering them is crucial!

### Understanding Percentages

**Percentage** means "per hundred" (%)

**Converting Between Forms**:
```
Percentage → Decimal: Divide by 100
50% = 50 ÷ 100 = 0.50

Decimal → Percentage: Multiply by 100
0.75 = 0.75 × 100 = 75%

Fraction → Percentage: Divide, then multiply by 100
3/4 = 0.75 = 75%
```

### Calculating Percentages

**Formula**: (Part ÷ Whole) × 100 = Percentage

**Example 1**: What percentage of sales came from Product A?
```
Product A sales: $15,000
Total sales: $50,000
Calculation: ($15,000 ÷ $50,000) × 100 = 30%
Answer: Product A represents 30% of sales
```

**Example 2**: Finding the part from a percentage
```
Question: What is 35% of $2,000?
Calculation: 0.35 × $2,000 = $700
```

**Example 3**: Finding the whole from a percentage
```
Question: $450 represents 15% of what amount?
Calculation: $450 ÷ 0.15 = $3,000
```

### Percentage Increase and Decrease

**Percentage Change Formula**:
```
% Change = [(New Value - Old Value) ÷ Old Value] × 100
```

**Example 1**: Sales Growth
```
Last Year: $80,000
This Year: $95,000
Change: $95,000 - $80,000 = $15,000
% Change: ($15,000 ÷ $80,000) × 100 = 18.75% increase
```

**Example 2**: Price Reduction
```
Original Price: $250
New Price: $200
Change: $200 - $250 = −$50
% Change: (−$50 ÷ $250) × 100 = −20% (20% decrease)
```

### Markup and Markdown

**Markup**: Increasing price above cost
```
Cost: $60
Markup: 40%
Selling Price = $60 + ($60 × 0.40) = $60 + $24 = $84

Formula: Selling Price = Cost × (1 + Markup %)
$60 × 1.40 = $84
```

**Markdown (Discount)**: Reducing from original price
```
Original Price: $100
Markdown: 25%
Sale Price = $100 - ($100 × 0.25) = $100 - $25 = $75

Formula: Sale Price = Original × (1 - Markdown %)
$100 × 0.75 = $75
```

**Important Note**: Markup and margin are different!
```
Cost: $50
Selling Price: $75

Markup (on cost): ($75 - $50) ÷ $50 = 50%
Margin (on selling price): ($75 - $50) ÷ $75 = 33.33%
```

### Profit Margin

**Gross Profit Margin**:
```
Formula: (Revenue - Cost of Goods) ÷ Revenue × 100

Example:
Revenue: $100,000
Cost of Goods: $60,000
Gross Profit: $40,000
Margin: ($40,000 ÷ $100,000) × 100 = 40%
```

**Net Profit Margin**:
```
Formula: Net Profit ÷ Revenue × 100

Example:
Revenue: $100,000
All Expenses: $85,000
Net Profit: $15,000
Margin: ($15,000 ÷ $100,000) × 100 = 15%
```

### Ratios

**Ratio**: Comparison between two numbers

**Expressing Ratios**:
- As fraction: 3/4
- With colon: 3:4
- In words: "3 to 4"

**Example 1**: Staff Ratio
```
Managers: 2
Staff: 8
Ratio: 2:8 or simplified 1:4
Meaning: For every 1 manager, there are 4 staff
```

**Example 2**: Dividing by Ratio
```
Problem: Split $12,000 profit between two partners in ratio 2:3

Step 1: Add ratio parts: 2 + 3 = 5
Step 2: Find one part: $12,000 ÷ 5 = $2,400
Step 3: Multiply by ratio:
  Partner A: 2 × $2,400 = $4,800
  Partner B: 3 × $2,400 = $7,200
Check: $4,800 + $7,200 = $12,000 ✓
```

**Example 3**: Asset to Liability Ratio
```
Assets: $500,000
Liabilities: $200,000
Ratio: $500,000:$200,000 = 5:2 or 2.5:1
Interpretation: For every $1 of liability, there's $2.50 of assets
```

### Proportions

**Proportion**: Equation stating two ratios are equal

**Example**: Scaling Recipe
```
Original: 2 cups flour makes 12 cookies
Question: How much flour for 30 cookies?

Set up proportion: 2/12 = x/30
Cross multiply: 12x = 60
Solve: x = 5 cups
```

**Business Application**: Unit Costs
```
If 100 units cost $2,500, what do 350 units cost?

Proportion: $2,500/100 = x/350
Solution: x = ($2,500 × 350) ÷ 100 = $8,750
```

---

## Interest Calculations

Interest is the cost of borrowing money or the return on investing money.

### Simple Interest

**Formula**:
```
I = P × r × t

Where:
I = Interest earned/paid
P = Principal (starting amount)
r = Interest rate (as decimal)
t = Time (in years)
```

**Example 1**: Loan Interest
```
Borrow: $5,000 (P)
Rate: 8% per year (r = 0.08)
Time: 3 years (t = 3)

Interest: $5,000 × 0.08 × 3 = $1,200
Total to Repay: $5,000 + $1,200 = $6,200
```

**Example 2**: Savings Account
```
Deposit: $10,000
Rate: 5% per year
Time: 18 months = 1.5 years

Interest: $10,000 × 0.05 × 1.5 = $750
Final Balance: $10,000 + $750 = $10,750
```

**Monthly Interest Rate**:
```
Annual Rate: 12%
Monthly Rate: 12% ÷ 12 = 1% per month

For $1,000 over 6 months:
Interest: $1,000 × 0.01 × 6 = $60
```

### Compound Interest

With compound interest, you earn interest on your interest!

**Formula**:
```
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
A = Final amount
P = Principal
r = Annual interest rate (decimal)
n = Number of times interest compounds per year
t = Time in years
```

**Compounding Frequencies**:
- Annually: n = 1
- Semi-annually: n = 2
- Quarterly: n = 4
- Monthly: n = 12
- Daily: n = 365

**Example 1**: Quarterly Compounding
```
Principal: $10,000
Rate: 8% per year (0.08)
Time: 5 years
Compound: Quarterly (n = 4)

A = $10,000(1 + 0.08/4)^(4×5)
A = $10,000(1 + 0.02)^20
A = $10,000(1.02)^20
A = $10,000 × 1.4859
A = $14,859

Total Interest Earned: $14,859 - $10,000 = $4,859
```

**Comparison**: Simple vs. Compound
```
Principal: $10,000
Rate: 8%
Time: 5 years

Simple Interest:
I = $10,000 × 0.08 × 5 = $4,000
Total: $14,000

Compound Interest (annual):
A = $10,000(1.08)^5 = $14,693
Interest: $4,693

Difference: $693 more with compound interest!
```

**The Power of More Frequent Compounding**:
```
$10,000 at 8% for 5 years:

Annual (n=1): $14,693
Quarterly (n=4): $14,859
Monthly (n=12): $14,898
Daily (n=365): $14,918

More frequent = More interest earned!
```

### Continuous Compounding

The mathematical limit of compounding:

**Formula**:
```
A = Pe^(rt)

Where e ≈ 2.71828 (mathematical constant)
```

**Example**:
```
Principal: $10,000
Rate: 8%
Time: 5 years

A = $10,000 × e^(0.08×5)
A = $10,000 × e^0.4
A = $10,000 × 1.4918
A = $14,918
```

### Annual Percentage Rate (APR) vs APY

**APR (Annual Percentage Rate)**: Simple annual rate
**APY (Annual Percentage Yield)**: Effective rate with compounding

**Converting APR to APY**:
```
APY = (1 + APR/n)^n - 1

Example: 12% APR, monthly compounding
APY = (1 + 0.12/12)^12 - 1
APY = (1.01)^12 - 1
APY = 1.1268 - 1
APY = 0.1268 or 12.68%
```

**Why It Matters**:
```
Credit Card: 18% APR, monthly compounding
Real Cost (APY): 19.56%

You're actually paying 19.56%, not 18%!
```

### Loan Amortization

**Monthly Payment Formula** (for loans):
```
M = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]

Where:
M = Monthly payment
P = Loan principal
r = Monthly interest rate (annual rate ÷ 12)
n = Total number of payments
```

**Example**: Car Loan
```
Loan Amount: $25,000
Annual Rate: 6% (monthly rate = 0.06/12 = 0.005)
Term: 5 years (60 months)

M = $25,000 × [0.005(1.005)^60] / [(1.005)^60 - 1]
M = $25,000 × [0.005 × 1.3489] / [1.3489 - 1]
M = $25,000 × 0.006745 / 0.3489
M = $483.32 per month

Total Paid: $483.32 × 60 = $28,999
Total Interest: $28,999 - $25,000 = $3,999
```

## Business Statistics

Statistics help you understand data and make informed decisions.

### Measures of Central Tendency

These tell you the "center" or "typical value" of data.

**1. Mean (Average)**:
```
Formula: Sum of all values ÷ Number of values

Example: Monthly sales
Jan: $12,000
Feb: $15,000
Mar: $13,000
Apr: $14,000
May: $16,000

Mean = ($12,000 + $15,000 + $13,000 + $14,000 + $16,000) ÷ 5
Mean = $70,000 ÷ 5 = $14,000

Average monthly sales: $14,000
```

**2. Median (Middle Value)**:
```
Process:
1. Arrange values in order
2. Find middle value
3. If even number of values, average the two middle ones

Example: Employee Salaries
$30,000, $35,000, $38,000, $42,000, $90,000

Median = $38,000 (middle value)

Note: Median ($38,000) vs Mean ($47,000)
Median is better here - not affected by the outlier $90,000
```

**3. Mode (Most Frequent)**:
```
Example: Customer Orders
Product A: 45 orders
Product B: 67 orders
Product C: 67 orders
Product D: 23 orders

Mode = Products B and C (both appear 67 times)
These are your most popular products
```

**When to Use Which**:
- **Mean**: Normal data without extreme outliers
- **Median**: When you have outliers or skewed data
- **Mode**: For categorical data or finding most common value

### Measures of Spread

These tell you how spread out your data is.

**1. Range**:
```
Formula: Maximum Value - Minimum Value

Example: Daily Sales
Monday: $2,500
Tuesday: $3,100
Wednesday: $2,800
Thursday: $4,200
Friday: $3,900

Range = $4,200 - $2,500 = $1,700
Sales vary by up to $1,700 per day
```

**2. Variance**:
Measures average squared distance from mean.

```
Steps:
1. Find the mean
2. Subtract mean from each value
3. Square each difference
4. Average the squared differences

Example: Sales (in thousands)
Values: 10, 12, 14, 16, 18
Mean: 14

Differences: -4, -2, 0, 2, 4
Squared: 16, 4, 0, 4, 16
Sum: 40
Variance: 40 ÷ 5 = 8
```

**3. Standard Deviation**:
Square root of variance (more intuitive to interpret).

```
Standard Deviation = √Variance
From above: √8 ≈ 2.83

Interpretation: Values typically differ from mean by $2,830
```

**Why It Matters**:
```
Store A daily sales: Mean $5,000, SD $500
Store B daily sales: Mean $5,000, SD $2,000

Both have same average, but Store B is much more unpredictable!
Store A: More consistent (easier to manage inventory)
Store B: More volatile (need flexible staffing)
```

### Percentiles and Quartiles

**Percentiles**: Divide data into 100 equal parts
```
Example: You scored in 85th percentile on test
Meaning: You scored better than 85% of test-takers
```

**Quartiles**: Divide data into 4 equal parts
- **Q1 (25th percentile)**: Bottom quarter
- **Q2 (50th percentile)**: Median
- **Q3 (75th percentile)**: Top quarter

**Example**: Employee Salaries
```
Data (sorted): $30k, $35k, $40k, $45k, $50k, $55k, $60k, $70k

Q1 = $37.5k (25% earn less)
Q2 = $47.5k (median)
Q3 = $57.5k (75% earn less)

Interquartile Range (IQR) = Q3 - Q1 = $57.5k - $37.5k = $20k
This is where the middle 50% of salaries fall
```

### Data Visualization Basics

**1. Bar Chart**: Comparing categories
```
Use for: Sales by product, revenue by region

Example Data:
Product A: $50k
Product B: $35k
Product C: $60k

Shows: Which products perform best
```

**2. Line Chart**: Trends over time
```
Use for: Monthly revenue, stock prices

Shows: Patterns, growth, seasonality
```

**3. Pie Chart**: Parts of a whole
```
Use for: Market share, expense breakdown

Example: Expense Budget
Rent: 30%
Salaries: 50%
Supplies: 10%
Marketing: 10%

Shows: Proportions of total
```

**4. Histogram**: Distribution of numerical data
```
Use for: Age distribution, income ranges

Shows: Shape of data, where most values cluster
```

### Index Numbers

Index numbers track changes relative to a base period.

**Formula**:
```
Index = (Current Value ÷ Base Value) × 100
```

**Example**: Price Index
```
Base Year (2020) Price: $50 (Index = 100)

2021 Price: $53
Index: ($53 ÷ $50) × 100 = 106
Interpretation: 6% increase from base year

2022 Price: $48
Index: ($48 ÷ $50) × 100 = 96
Interpretation: 4% decrease from base year

2023 Price: $60
Index: ($60 ÷ $50) × 100 = 120
Interpretation: 20% increase from base year
```

**Consumer Price Index (CPI)**:
Measures inflation - how much the cost of goods increases over time.

```
If CPI goes from 100 to 105:
Inflation = 5%
Your money buys 5% less than before
```

---

## Financial Mathematics

### Revenue, Cost, and Profit

The fundamental equation of business:

**Profit = Revenue - Total Costs**

**Revenue (Income/Sales)**:
```
Revenue = Price per Unit × Number of Units Sold

Example:
Sold 500 shirts at $25 each
Revenue = 500 × $25 = $12,500
```

**Total Costs** = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs

**Fixed Costs**: Stay the same regardless of production
- Rent, salaries, insurance
- Example: $5,000/month rent

**Variable Costs**: Change with production level
- Materials, hourly labor, shipping
- Example: $8 per shirt produced

**Total Cost Equation**:
```
Total Cost = Fixed Costs + (Variable Cost per Unit × Quantity)

Example:
Fixed Costs: $5,000
Variable Cost: $8 per shirt
Quantity: 500 shirts

Total Cost = $5,000 + ($8 × 500)
Total Cost = $5,000 + $4,000 = $9,000
```

**Calculating Profit**:
```
Revenue: $12,500
Total Costs: $9,000
Profit: $12,500 - $9,000 = $3,500
```

### Average Cost vs Marginal Cost

**Average Cost per Unit**:
```
Average Cost = Total Cost ÷ Quantity

From above:
Average Cost = $9,000 ÷ 500 = $18 per shirt
```

**Marginal Cost**:
Cost to produce one more unit (usually = variable cost)
```
In our example: $8 per additional shirt
```

**Why It Matters**:
```
Selling Price: $25
Marginal Cost: $8
Contribution per sale: $25 - $8 = $17

Each additional shirt sold adds $17 toward covering fixed costs
and eventually profit!
```

### Operating Leverage

How fixed costs affect profit changes:

```
Scenario 1: Low Fixed Costs
Fixed: $1,000
Variable per unit: $15
Price: $25

At 500 units:
Revenue: $12,500
Costs: $1,000 + (500 × $15) = $8,500
Profit: $4,000

At 600 units (+20%):
Revenue: $15,000
Costs: $1,000 + (600 × $15) = $10,000
Profit: $5,000 (+25%)

Scenario 2: High Fixed Costs
Fixed: $5,000
Variable per unit: $8
Price: $25

At 500 units:
Revenue: $12,500
Costs: $5,000 + (500 × $8) = $9,000
Profit: $3,500

At 600 units (+20%):
Revenue: $15,000
Costs: $5,000 + (600 × $8) = $9,800
Profit: $5,200 (+49%)

Higher fixed costs = Greater profit volatility!
```

### Budget Variance Analysis

Comparing actual results to budget:

**Variance = Actual - Budget**
- Positive = Better than expected
- Negative = Worse than expected

**Example**:
```
          Budget    Actual    Variance    % Variance
Revenue   $50,000   $48,000   -$2,000     -4.0%
Costs     $30,000   $28,500   +$1,500     +5.0% (good!)
Profit    $20,000   $19,500   -$500       -2.5%

Analysis:
- Revenue: 4% below target (need investigation)
- Costs: 5% under budget (good cost control)
- Profit: Slightly below target due to revenue shortfall
```

---

## Break-Even Analysis

Break-even point: Where total revenue equals total costs (no profit, no loss).

### Break-Even in Units

**Formula**:
```
Break-Even Units = Fixed Costs ÷ (Price - Variable Cost per Unit)
```

The denominator (Price - Variable Cost) is called **Contribution Margin per Unit**.

**Example**:
```
Fixed Costs: $10,000
Price per Unit: $50
Variable Cost per Unit: $30

Contribution Margin: $50 - $30 = $20

Break-Even Units: $10,000 ÷ $20 = 500 units

You must sell 500 units to break even
```

**Verification**:
```
At 500 units:
Revenue: 500 × $50 = $25,000
Variable Costs: 500 × $30 = $15,000
Fixed Costs: $10,000
Total Costs: $15,000 + $10,000 = $25,000
Profit: $25,000 - $25,000 = $0 ✓
```

### Break-Even in Dollars

**Formula**:
```
Break-Even Sales = Fixed Costs ÷ Contribution Margin Ratio

Where:
Contribution Margin Ratio = (Price - Variable Cost) ÷ Price
```

**Example**:
```
Fixed Costs: $10,000
Price: $50
Variable Cost: $30

CM Ratio: ($50 - $30) ÷ $50 = $20 ÷ $50 = 0.40 or 40%

Break-Even Sales: $10,000 ÷ 0.40 = $25,000

You need $25,000 in sales to break even
```

### Break-Even with Multiple Products

**Example**: Coffee Shop
```
Product          Price   Var Cost   Units Sold   Sales Mix
Espresso         $4.00   $1.00      400          40%
Cappuccino       $5.00   $1.50      300          30%
Pastry           $3.00   $1.00      300          30%
Total                               1,000         100%

Fixed Costs: $2,000/month

Step 1: Calculate weighted average contribution margin
Espresso: ($4 - $1) × 0.40 = $1.20
Cappuccino: ($5 - $1.50) × 0.30 = $1.05
Pastry: ($3 - $1) × 0.30 = $0.60
Weighted Average CM = $2.85

Step 2: Calculate break-even units
Break-Even = $2,000 ÷ $2.85 = 702 total units

Step 3: Break down by product (using sales mix)
Espresso: 702 × 0.40 = 281 units
Cappuccino: 702 × 0.30 = 211 units
Pastry: 702 × 0.30 = 211 units
```

### Target Profit Analysis

**Formula**:
```
Units for Target Profit = (Fixed Costs + Target Profit) ÷ Contribution Margin
```

**Example**:
```
Fixed Costs: $10,000
Target Profit: $5,000
Price: $50
Variable Cost: $30
CM: $20

Required Units: ($10,000 + $5,000) ÷ $20 = 750 units

To make $5,000 profit, you need to sell 750 units
```

### Margin of Safety

How far sales can drop before you hit break-even:

**Formula**:
```
Margin of Safety = Actual Sales - Break-Even Sales
Margin of Safety % = (Actual - Break-Even) ÷ Actual × 100
```

**Example**:
```
Actual Sales: $50,000
Break-Even Sales: $25,000

Margin of Safety: $50,000 - $25,000 = $25,000
MOS %: $25,000 ÷ $50,000 × 100 = 50%

Your sales can drop by 50% before you start losing money
```

## Pricing and Profit

### Pricing Strategies

**1. Cost-Plus Pricing**:
```
Selling Price = Total Cost per Unit + Desired Profit

Example:
Cost per unit: $40
Desired profit: $20
Selling Price: $40 + $20 = $60

Or as percentage markup:
30% markup on cost
Selling Price: $40 × 1.30 = $52
```

**2. Markup on Cost**:
```
Markup % = (Selling Price - Cost) ÷ Cost × 100

Example:
Cost: $50
Selling Price: $75
Markup: ($75 - $50) ÷ $50 × 100 = 50%
```

**3. Margin on Selling Price**:
```
Margin % = (Selling Price - Cost) ÷ Selling Price × 100

Same example:
Margin: ($75 - $50) ÷ $75 × 100 = 33.33%

Note: 50% markup ≠ 33.33% margin (different denominators!)
```

**Converting Between Markup and Margin**:
```
Markup to Margin: Margin = Markup ÷ (1 + Markup)
Example: 50% markup = 0.50 ÷ 1.50 = 33.33% margin

Margin to Markup: Markup = Margin ÷ (1 - Margin)
Example: 40% margin = 0.40 ÷ 0.60 = 66.67% markup
```

### Pricing for Desired Profit Margin

**Formula**:
```
Selling Price = Cost ÷ (1 - Desired Margin %)
```

**Example**:
```
Cost per unit: $60
Desired margin: 40%

Selling Price: $60 ÷ (1 - 0.40)
Selling Price: $60 ÷ 0.60 = $100

Check:
Margin: ($100 - $60) ÷ $100 = 40% ✓
```

### Volume Discounts

**Example**:
```
Regular price: $10 per unit

Volume Discount Structure:
1-99 units: $10 each
100-499 units: $9 each (10% discount)
500+ units: $8 each (20% discount)

Customer orders 450 units:
Revenue: 450 × $9 = $4,050

If they ordered 500:
Revenue: 500 × $8 = $4,000
Per-unit revenue drops, but may increase total profit if more volume
```

### Price Elasticity

How quantity demanded changes when price changes:

**Formula**:
```
Price Elasticity = (% Change in Quantity) ÷ (% Change in Price)
```

**Example**:
```
Original: 1,000 units at $20
New: 800 units at $25

% Change in Quantity: (800 - 1,000) ÷ 1,000 = -20%
% Change in Price: ($25 - $20) ÷ $20 = 25%

Elasticity: -20% ÷ 25% = -0.8
```

**Interpretation**:
- Elasticity > 1: Elastic (sensitive to price)
- Elasticity < 1: Inelastic (not sensitive to price)
- Elasticity = 1: Unit elastic

```
In example above: -0.8 (inelastic)
Raising prices increases revenue despite lower quantity

Let's check:
Original Revenue: 1,000 × $20 = $20,000
New Revenue: 800 × $25 = $20,000
Actually same! Close to unit elastic.
```

## Time Value of Money

A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow because you can invest it and earn returns.

### Present Value (PV)

What future money is worth today:

**Formula**:
```
PV = FV ÷ (1 + r)^n

Where:
FV = Future Value
r = Interest rate per period
n = Number of periods
```

**Example 1**:
```
Question: What is $10,000 in 5 years worth today at 8% interest?

PV = $10,000 ÷ (1.08)^5
PV = $10,000 ÷ 1.4693
PV = $6,806

Answer: $6,806 today equals $10,000 in 5 years
```

**Example 2**: Choosing Between Options
```
Option A: $5,000 today
Option B: $7,000 in 4 years
Discount rate: 10%

PV of Option B: $7,000 ÷ (1.10)^4 = $7,000 ÷ 1.4641 = $4,781

Comparison:
Option A: $5,000
Option B: $4,781 (in today's dollars)

Choose Option A!
```

### Future Value (FV)

What today's money will be worth in the future:

**Formula**:
```
FV = PV × (1 + r)^n
```

**Example**:
```
Invest $8,000 today at 6% for 10 years

FV = $8,000 × (1.06)^10
FV = $8,000 × 1.7908
FV = $14,327

Your $8,000 grows to $14,327
```

### Annuities

Series of equal payments at regular intervals.

**Two Types**:
1. **Ordinary Annuity**: Payments at end of period
2. **Annuity Due**: Payments at beginning of period

**Present Value of Ordinary Annuity**:
```
PV = PMT × [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) ÷ r]

Where:
PMT = Payment per period
r = Interest rate per period
n = Number of periods
```

**Example**: Lottery Payout
```
Win $50,000/year for 20 years
Discount rate: 7%

PV = $50,000 × [(1 - (1.07)^-20) ÷ 0.07]
PV = $50,000 × [(1 - 0.2584) ÷ 0.07]
PV = $50,000 × [0.7416 ÷ 0.07]
PV = $50,000 × 10.594
PV = $529,700

The payments are worth $529,700 today
If offered lump sum of $550,000, take it!
```

**Future Value of Ordinary Annuity**:
```
FV = PMT × [((1 + r)^n - 1) ÷ r]
```

**Example**: Retirement Savings
```
Save $500/month for 30 years
Annual return: 8% (monthly rate: 0.08/12 = 0.00667)
Periods: 30 × 12 = 360 months

FV = $500 × [((1.00667)^360 - 1) ÷ 0.00667]
FV = $500 × [(11.028 - 1) ÷ 0.00667]
FV = $500 × 1,504.2
FV = $752,100

Your $500/month grows to $752,100!
Total invested: $500 × 360 = $180,000
Interest earned: $752,100 - $180,000 = $572,100
```

### Perpetuities

Payments that continue forever:

**Formula**:
```
PV = PMT ÷ r
```

**Example**: Endowment Fund
```
Want to fund $50,000 scholarship annually forever
Discount rate: 5%

PV = $50,000 ÷ 0.05 = $1,000,000

Need $1 million endowment to generate $50,000/year forever
```

## Investment Analysis

### Return on Investment (ROI)

**Formula**:
```
ROI = (Gain from Investment - Cost of Investment) ÷ Cost × 100
```

**Example 1**: Stock Investment
```
Bought stock: $5,000
Sold stock: $6,200

ROI = ($6,200 - $5,000) ÷ $5,000 × 100
ROI = $1,200 ÷ $5,000 × 100
ROI = 24%
```

**Example 2**: Business Investment
```
Invested in new equipment: $50,000
Increased annual profit by: $12,000

Annual ROI: $12,000 ÷ $50,000 × 100 = 24%
Payback period: $50,000 ÷ $12,000 = 4.17 years
```

### Net Present Value (NPV)

NPV tells you if an investment is worthwhile by comparing present value of cash inflows to outflows.

**Formula**:
```
NPV = Sum of [Cash Flow ÷ (1 + r)^t] - Initial Investment

Where:
r = Discount rate
t = Time period
```

**Decision Rule**:
- NPV > 0: Accept (creates value)
- NPV < 0: Reject (destroys value)
- NPV = 0: Indifferent

**Example**: New Equipment
```
Initial Cost: $100,000
Expected cash flows:
Year 1: $30,000
Year 2: $40,000
Year 3: $45,000
Year 4: $35,000
Discount rate: 10%

Calculations:
Year 0: -$100,000 (initial investment)
Year 1: $30,000 ÷ (1.10)^1 = $27,273
Year 2: $40,000 ÷ (1.10)^2 = $33,058
Year 3: $45,000 ÷ (1.10)^3 = $33,809
Year 4: $35,000 ÷ (1.10)^4 = $23,915

NPV = -$100,000 + $27,273 + $33,058 + $33,809 + $23,915
NPV = $18,055

Decision: Accept! NPV is positive - investment creates $18,055 in value
```

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

The discount rate that makes NPV = 0

**Interpretation**: The actual return rate of an investment

**Example**:
```
Investment: $10,000
Returns: $3,000/year for 5 years

Find the rate that makes:
-$10,000 + $3,000/(1+IRR) + $3,000/(1+IRR)^2 + ... = 0

Solution: IRR ≈ 15.2%

If your required return is 12%, accept (15.2% > 12%)
If your required return is 18%, reject (15.2% < 18%)
```

### Payback Period

Time to recover initial investment:

**Formula**:
```
Payback Period = Initial Investment ÷ Annual Cash Flow
(For even cash flows)
```

**Example 1**: Even Cash Flows
```
Investment: $50,000
Annual Cash Flow: $12,500

Payback: $50,000 ÷ $12,500 = 4 years
```

**Example 2**: Uneven Cash Flows
```
Investment: $75,000
Cash flows:
Year 1: $20,000 (Cumulative: $20,000)
Year 2: $25,000 (Cumulative: $45,000)
Year 3: $30,000 (Cumulative: $75,000)

Payback Period: 3 years

After Year 2: Still need $30,000
Year 3 generates: $30,000
Payback happens exactly at end of Year 3
```

**Discounted Payback Period**:
Same concept but using present values:
```
Investment: $75,000
Discount rate: 10%

Year 1: $20,000 ÷ 1.10 = $18,182 (Cum: $18,182)
Year 2: $25,000 ÷ 1.21 = $20,661 (Cum: $38,843)
Year 3: $30,000 ÷ 1.331 = $22,538 (Cum: $61,381)
Year 4: $28,000 ÷ 1.464 = $19,126 (Cum: $80,507)

Discounted Payback: Between 3 and 4 years
```

### Comparing Investment Options

**Example**: Three Projects
```
                Project A    Project B    Project C
Initial Cost    $50,000      $50,000      $50,000
NPV @ 12%       $8,000       $12,000      $6,000
IRR             15%          18%          14%
Payback         3.5 years    4.2 years    3.0 years

Analysis:
Best NPV: Project B ($12,000)
Best IRR: Project B (18%)
Fastest Payback: Project C (3.0 years)

If focusing on value creation: Choose Project B
If need quick cash recovery: Consider Project C
```

## Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation spreads the cost of an asset over its useful life.

### Straight-Line Depreciation

Equal amount each year (most common method):

**Formula**:
```
Annual Depreciation = (Cost - Salvage Value) ÷ Useful Life
```

**Example**:
```
Equipment Cost: $50,000
Salvage Value: $5,000 (value at end of life)
Useful Life: 5 years

Annual Depreciation: ($50,000 - $5,000) ÷ 5 = $9,000/year

Year  Beginning   Depreciation  Accumulated   Book
      Value                     Depreciation  Value
1     $50,000     $9,000       $9,000        $41,000
2     $41,000     $9,000       $18,000       $32,000
3     $32,000     $9,000       $27,000       $23,000
4     $23,000     $9,000       $36,000       $14,000
5     $14,000     $9,000       $45,000       $5,000

Final book value equals salvage value
```

### Declining Balance Depreciation

Accelerated method - higher depreciation in early years:

**Double Declining Balance (Most Common)**:
```
Rate = 2 ÷ Useful Life
Annual Depreciation = Book Value × Rate
```

**Example**:
```
Cost: $50,000
Salvage: $5,000
Life: 5 years
Rate: 2 ÷ 5 = 40%

Year  Beginning   Depreciation        Book
      Value       (BV × 40%)         Value
1     $50,000     $20,000            $30,000
2     $30,000     $12,000            $18,000
3     $18,000     $7,200             $10,800
4     $10,800     $4,320             $6,480
5     $6,480      $1,480*            $5,000

*Last year adjusted to reach salvage value
Can't depreciate below salvage value
```

### Units of Production Depreciation

Based on actual usage:

**Formula**:
```
Depreciation per Unit = (Cost - Salvage) ÷ Total Expected Units

Annual Depreciation = Depreciation per Unit × Units This Year
```

**Example**: Delivery Vehicle
```
Cost: $40,000
Salvage: $4,000
Expected miles: 180,000

Per Mile: ($40,000 - $4,000) ÷ 180,000 = $0.20/mile

Year  Miles    Depreciation        Accumulated   Book
      Driven   (Miles × $0.20)     Depreciation  Value
1     45,000   $9,000             $9,000        $31,000
2     50,000   $10,000            $19,000       $21,000
3     38,000   $7,600             $26,600       $13,400
4     32,000   $6,400             $33,000       $7,000
5     15,000   $3,000             $36,000       $4,000
```

### Sum-of-Years-Digits (SYD)

Another accelerated method:

**Formula**:
```
SYD = n(n+1) ÷ 2  where n = useful life

Year Depreciation = (Remaining life ÷ SYD) × (Cost - Salvage)
```

**Example**:
```
Cost: $50,000
Salvage: $5,000
Life: 5 years
SYD: 5(6) ÷ 2 = 15

Depreciable amount: $45,000

Year  Fraction    Depreciation           Book Value
1     5/15        $45,000 × 5/15 = $15,000   $35,000
2     4/15        $45,000 × 4/15 = $12,000   $23,000
3     3/15        $45,000 × 3/15 = $9,000    $14,000
4     2/15        $45,000 × 2/15 = $6,000    $8,000
5     1/15        $45,000 × 1/15 = $3,000    $5,000
```

### Tax Impact of Depreciation

**Example**:
```
Company Income Statement:
Revenue: $500,000
Operating Expenses: $300,000
Depreciation: $50,000
Taxable Income: $150,000
Tax Rate: 25%
Taxes: $37,500

Without Depreciation:
Taxable Income: $200,000
Taxes: $50,000

Depreciation saves: $50,000 - $37,500 = $12,500 in taxes
This is called "tax shield"
```

---

## Financial Ratios

Financial ratios help analyze business performance and health.

### Liquidity Ratios

Measure ability to pay short-term obligations:

**1. Current Ratio**:
```
Current Ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities

Example:
Current Assets: $150,000
Current Liabilities: $75,000
Current Ratio: $150,000 ÷ $75,000 = 2.0

Interpretation: For every $1 of short-term debt, 
we have $2 of assets to pay it
Good: Ratio > 1.5
Warning: Ratio < 1.0
```

**2. Quick Ratio (Acid Test)**:
```
Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities

Example:
Current Assets: $150,000
Inventory: $40,000
Current Liabilities: $75,000
Quick Ratio: ($150,000 - $40,000) ÷ $75,000 = 1.47

More conservative than current ratio (excludes inventory)
Good: Ratio > 1.0
```

**3. Cash Ratio**:
```
Cash Ratio = Cash ÷ Current Liabilities

Example:
Cash: $30,000
Current Liabilities: $75,000
Cash Ratio: $30,000 ÷ $75,000 = 0.40

Most conservative liquidity measure
Can pay 40% of short-term debt with cash immediately
```

### Profitability Ratios

Measure how efficiently company generates profit:

**1. Gross Profit Margin**:
```
Gross Profit Margin = (Revenue - COGS) ÷ Revenue × 100

Example:
Revenue: $500,000
Cost of Goods Sold: $300,000
Gross Profit: $200,000
Margin: $200,000 ÷ $500,000 × 100 = 40%

40 cents of every sales dollar remains after direct costs
```

**2. Operating Profit Margin**:
```
Operating Margin = Operating Income ÷ Revenue × 100

Example:
Operating Income: $100,000
Revenue: $500,000
Margin: $100,000 ÷ $500,000 × 100 = 20%

20% of revenue remains after operating expenses
```

**3. Net Profit Margin**:
```
Net Margin = Net Income ÷ Revenue × 100

Example:
Net Income: $60,000
Revenue: $500,000
Margin: $60,000 ÷ $500,000 × 100 = 12%

12 cents profit from every dollar of sales
```

**4. Return on Assets (ROA)**:
```
ROA = Net Income ÷ Total Assets × 100

Example:
Net Income: $60,000
Total Assets: $400,000
ROA: $60,000 ÷ $400,000 × 100 = 15%

Generates $15 profit for every $100 of assets
```

**5. Return on Equity (ROE)**:
```
ROE = Net Income ÷ Shareholders' Equity × 100

Example:
Net Income: $60,000
Equity: $250,000
ROE: $60,000 ÷ $250,000 × 100 = 24%

Shareholders earn 24% return on their investment
```

### Efficiency Ratios

Measure how well company uses assets:

**1. Inventory Turnover**:
```
Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold ÷ Average Inventory

Example:
COGS: $300,000
Average Inventory: $50,000
Turnover: $300,000 ÷ $50,000 = 6 times

Inventory is sold and replaced 6 times per year

Days in Inventory = 365 ÷ 6 = 61 days
Inventory sits for 61 days on average before selling
```

**2. Accounts Receivable Turnover**:
```
AR Turnover = Net Credit Sales ÷ Average Accounts Receivable

Example:
Credit Sales: $400,000
Average AR: $50,000
Turnover: $400,000 ÷ $50,000 = 8 times

Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) = 365 ÷ 8 = 46 days
Takes 46 days on average to collect payment
```

**3. Asset Turnover**:
```
Asset Turnover = Revenue ÷ Total Assets

Example:
Revenue: $500,000
Total Assets: $400,000
Turnover: $500,000 ÷ $400,000 = 1.25

Generates $1.25 in sales for every $1 of assets
```

### Leverage (Solvency) Ratios

Measure long-term financial stability:

**1. Debt-to-Equity Ratio**:
```
Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt ÷ Total Equity

Example:
Total Debt: $150,000
Total Equity: $250,000
Ratio: $150,000 ÷ $250,000 = 0.60

60 cents of debt for every dollar of equity
Lower is generally better (less risky)
```

**2. Debt-to-Assets Ratio**:
```
Debt-to-Assets = Total Debt ÷ Total Assets

Example:
Total Debt: $150,000
Total Assets: $400,000
Ratio: $150,000 ÷ $400,000 = 0.375 or 37.5%

37.5% of assets financed by debt
```

**3. Interest Coverage Ratio**:
```
Interest Coverage = EBIT ÷ Interest Expense

Example:
EBIT (Operating Income): $100,000
Interest Expense: $15,000
Coverage: $100,000 ÷ $15,000 = 6.67 times

Can pay interest 6.67 times over
Good: Ratio > 3
Warning: Ratio < 1.5
```

### Market Value Ratios

**1. Earnings Per Share (EPS)**:
```
EPS = Net Income ÷ Number of Shares Outstanding

Example:
Net Income: $200,000
Shares: 50,000
EPS: $200,000 ÷ 50,000 = $4.00 per share
```

**2. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**:
```
P/E Ratio = Stock Price ÷ EPS

Example:
Stock Price: $60
EPS: $4.00
P/E: $60 ÷ $4.00 = 15

Investors pay $15 for every $1 of earnings
High P/E: Growth expectations
Low P/E: Value or concerns
```

**3. Dividend Yield**:
```
Dividend Yield = Annual Dividend per Share ÷ Stock Price × 100

Example:
Annual Dividend: $2.00
Stock Price: $60
Yield: $2.00 ÷ $60 × 100 = 3.33%

Shareholders earn 3.33% return from dividends alone
```

### DuPont Analysis

Breaks down ROE into components:

```
ROE = Net Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier

Where:
Net Margin = Net Income ÷ Revenue
Asset Turnover = Revenue ÷ Assets
Equity Multiplier = Assets ÷ Equity

Example:
Net Income: $60,000
Revenue: $500,000
Assets: $400,000
Equity: $250,000

Net Margin: $60,000 ÷ $500,000 = 0.12 (12%)

## Forecasting and Trends

### Time Series Analysis

**Components of Time Series**:
1. **Trend**: Long-term direction
2. **Seasonality**: Regular patterns
3. **Cyclical**: Long-term oscillations
4. **Random**: Unpredictable variation

### Simple Moving Average

**Formula**:
```
Moving Average = Sum of last n values ÷ n
```

**Example**: 3-Month Moving Average
```
Month    Sales     3-Month MA
Jan      $10,000   -
Feb      $12,000   -
Mar      $11,000   $11,000 (avg of Jan-Mar)
Apr      $13,000   $12,000 (avg of Feb-Apr)
May      $14,000   $12,667 (avg of Mar-May)
Jun      $12,000   $13,000 (avg of Apr-Jun)

Smooths out random variations
Helps identify trend
```

### Weighted Moving Average

Give more weight to recent data:

**Example**:
```
Month    Sales     Weight    Calculation
Apr      $13,000   1         $13,000 × 1 = $13,000
May      $14,000   2         $14,000 × 2 = $28,000
Jun      $12,000   3         $12,000 × 3 = $36,000
                   6         Sum: $77,000

Weighted MA: $77,000 ÷ 6 = $12,833

More responsive to recent changes than simple MA
```

### Exponential Smoothing

**Formula**:
```
Forecast = α × (Actual) + (1-α) × (Previous Forecast)

Where α (alpha) = smoothing constant (0 to 1)
```

**Example**: α = 0.3
```
Month   Actual    Forecast    Calculation
Jan     $10,000   $10,000     (initial)
Feb     $12,000   $10,000     
Mar     $11,000   $10,600     0.3(12,000) + 0.7(10,000)
Apr     $13,000   $10,720     0.3(11,000) + 0.7(10,600)
May     $14,000   $11,404     0.3(13,000) + 0.7(10,720)

Higher α = more weight to recent data
Lower α = smoother forecast
```

### Linear Trend Forecasting

**Simple Linear Trend**:
```
y = a + bx

Where:
y = predicted value
x = time period
a = y-intercept
b = slope (trend)
```

**Example**: Calculating Trend
```
Year    Sales (y)   x    xy        x²
2020    $100,000    1    $100,000  1
2021    $110,000    2    $220,000  4
2022    $125,000    3    $375,000  9
2023    $140,000    4    $560,000  16
Totals  $475,000    10   $1,255,000 30

n = 4 years

b = [n(Σxy) - (Σx)(Σy)] ÷ [n(Σx²) - (Σx)²]
b = [4(1,255,000) - 10(475,000)] ÷ [4(30) - 100]
b = [5,020,000 - 4,750,000] ÷ [120 - 100]
b = 270,000 ÷ 20 = $13,500

a = (Σy - bΣx) ÷ n
a = (475,000 - 13,500 × 10) ÷ 4
a = (475,000 - 135,000) ÷ 4 = $85,000

Trend Equation: y = $85,000 + $13,500x

Forecast 2024 (x=5): y = $85,000 + $13,500(5) = $152,500
Sales increasing $13,500 per year on average
```

### Percentage Growth Rate

**Formula**:
```
Growth Rate = [(Ending - Beginning) ÷ Beginning] × 100
```

**Example**: Quarterly Growth
```
Q1: $100,000
Q2: $115,000
Q3: $120,000
Q4: $130,000

Q2 Growth: [(115 - 100) ÷ 100] × 100 = 15.0%
Q3 Growth: [(120 - 115) ÷ 115] × 100 = 4.3%
Q4 Growth: [(130 - 120) ÷ 120] × 100 = 8.3%

Year Growth: [(130 - 100) ÷ 100] × 100 = 30.0%
```

**Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)**:
```
CAGR = [(Ending ÷ Beginning)^(1/years) - 1] × 100

Example:
2020: $100,000
2023: $140,000 (3 years)

CAGR = [(140,000 ÷ 100,000)^(1/3) - 1] × 100
CAGR = [1.40^0.333 - 1] × 100
CAGR = [1.1187 - 1] × 100
CAGR = 11.87% per year

Average annual growth rate over 3 years
```

### Seasonality Index

**Example**: Retail Sales by Quarter
```
         Q1      Q2      Q3      Q4      Total
2021    $80k    $90k    $85k    $145k   $400k
2022    $85k    $95k    $90k    $150k   $420k
2023    $90k    $100k   $95k    $155k   $440k
Total   $255k   $285k   $270k   $450k   $1,260k

Average Annual: $1,260k ÷ 3 = $420k
Average per Quarter: $420k ÷ 4 = $105k

Seasonal Index:
Q1: $85k ÷ $105k = 0.81 (19% below average)
Q2: $95k ÷ $105k = 0.90 (10% below average)
Q3: $90k ÷ $105k = 0.86 (14% below average)
Q4: $150k ÷ $105k = 1.43 (43% above average)

Q4 has strong seasonal boost (holidays)
```

## Risk and Probability

### Expected Value

**Formula**:
```
Expected Value = Σ (Outcome × Probability)
```

**Example**: New Product Launch
```
Outcome          Probability    Profit/Loss
Great Success    30%           $500,000
Moderate Success 50%           $150,000
Failure          20%           -$100,000

Expected Value:
= 0.30($500,000) + 0.50($150,000) + 0.20(-$100,000)
= $150,000 + $75,000 - $20,000
= $205,000

On average, expect $205,000 profit
```

### Decision Trees

**Example**: Marketing Campaign Decision
```
Decision: Spend $50,000 on campaign?

Option 1: Don't Spend
  Outcome: $100,000 revenue
  Net: $100,000

Option 2: Spend $50,000
  High Response (40%): $250,000 revenue
  Medium Response (35%): $180,000 revenue
  Low Response (25%): $120,000 revenue

Expected Revenue from Campaign:
= 0.40($250,000) + 0.35($180,000) + 0.25($120,000)
= $100,000 + $63,000 + $30,000
= $193,000

Net Expected Value: $193,000 - $50,000 = $143,000

Decision: Spend! ($143,000 > $100,000)
```

### Risk and Standard Deviation

**Example**: Investment Returns
```
Investment A:
Possible Returns: 5%, 10%, 15%
Probabilities: 33%, 34%, 33%

Expected Return: 0.33(5%) + 0.34(10%) + 0.33(15%)
= 1.65% + 3.4% + 4.95% = 10%

Investment B:
Possible Returns: -10%, 10%, 30%
Probabilities: 33%, 34%, 33%

Expected Return: 0.33(-10%) + 0.34(10%) + 0.33(30%)
= -3.3% + 3.4% + 9.9% = 10%

Both have same expected return (10%)
But Investment B is much riskier (wider range)

Standard deviation measures this risk
Higher SD = Higher risk
```

### Probability Concepts for Business

**Independent Events**:
```
Example: Two customers deciding to buy

P(Both buy) = P(Customer 1 buys) × P(Customer 2 buys)
If each has 30% chance: 0.30 × 0.30 = 0.09 or 9%
```

**Dependent Events**:
```
Example: Selecting products without replacement

Basket has 10 items: 7 good, 3 defective
Pick 2 items:

P(Both defective) = P(1st defective) × P(2nd defective | 1st defective)
= (3/10) × (2/9) = 6/90 = 0.067 or 6.7%
```

**Conditional Probability**:
```
P(A|B) = P(A and B) ÷ P(B)

Example: Marketing effectiveness
P(Buy | Saw Ad) = P(Buy and Saw Ad) ÷ P(Saw Ad)

If:
- 20% saw ad
- 5% both saw ad and bought
Then: P(Buy | Saw Ad) = 0.05 ÷ 0.20 = 0.25 or 25%

25% conversion rate among those who saw ad
```

## Advanced Business Calculations

### Loan Amortization Schedule

**Example**: $200,000 Loan
```
Principal: $200,000
Rate: 5% annual (0.4167% monthly)
Term: 30 years (360 payments)

Monthly Payment Formula:
M = P[r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n - 1]
M = $200,000[0.004167(1.004167)^360]/[(1.004167)^360 - 1]
M = $1,073.64

Amortization Table (first few months):
Month  Payment   Interest   Principal   Balance
0      -         -          -           $200,000.00
1      $1,073.64 $833.33    $240.31     $199,759.69
2      $1,073.64 $832.33    $241.31     $199,518.38
3      $1,073.64 $831.33    $242.31     $199,276.07

Interest = Balance × Monthly Rate
Principal = Payment - Interest
New Balance = Old Balance - Principal

Early payments mostly interest
Later payments mostly principal
```

### Lease vs Buy Analysis

**Example**: Company Vehicle
```
Option 1: Buy
Purchase Price: $40,000
Down Payment: $8,000
Loan: $32,000 at 4% for 5 years
Monthly Payment: $589
Estimated Resale Value: $15,000
Maintenance: $200/month

Option 2: Lease
Down Payment: $2,000
Monthly Lease: $450
Term: 3 years (36 months)
Maintenance Included
No resale value

Buy Analysis (5 years):
Down Payment: $8,000
Loan Payments: $589 × 60 = $35,340
Maintenance: $200 × 60 = $12,000
Total Costs: $55,340
Less Resale: -$15,000
Net Cost: $40,340

Lease Analysis (5 years, two leases):
Down Payments: $2,000 × 2 = $4,000
Lease Payments: $450 × 72 = $32,400
Total Cost: $36,400

Lease appears cheaper, but:
- No ownership
- Mileage restrictions
- No equity built
```

### Capital Budgeting with Taxes

**Example**: New Equipment
```
Equipment Cost: $100,000
Useful Life: 5 years
Annual Revenue Increase: $35,000
Annual Operating Costs: $8,000
Tax Rate: 30%
Required Return: 12%

Year-by-Year Analysis:
Revenue Increase: $35,000
Operating Costs: -$8,000
Depreciation (SL): -$20,000 ($100,000 ÷ 5)
Taxable Income: $7,000
Taxes (30%): -$2,100
After-Tax Income: $4,900

Add Back Depreciation (non-cash): +$20,000
Annual Cash Flow: $24,900

NPV Calculation:
Year 0: -$100,000
Years 1-5: $24,900 each

PV Factor (12%, 5 years): 3.605
PV of Cash Flows: $24,900 × 3.605 = $89,765
NPV: -$100,000 + $89,765 = -$10,235

Decision: Reject (negative NPV)
```

### Foreign Exchange Calculations

**Exchange Rates**:
```
Example: USD to EUR
Rate: 1 USD = 0.92 EUR

Convert $10,000 to EUR:
$10,000 × 0.92 = €9,200

Convert €5,000 to USD:
€5,000 ÷ 0.92 = $5,434.78

Cross Rates:
If USD to EUR: 0.92
And EUR to GBP: 0.85
Then USD to GBP: 0.92 × 0.85 = 0.782
```

**Percentage Change in Exchange Rate**:
```
Old Rate: 1 USD = 0.90 EUR
New Rate: 1 USD = 0.95 EUR

% Change: [(0.95 - 0.90) ÷ 0.90] × 100 = 5.56%
USD strengthened by 5.56% against EUR
```

### Inventory Management

**Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)**:
Optimal order size to minimize costs.

**Formula**:
```
EOQ = √[(2 × D × S) ÷ H]

Where:
D = Annual demand
S = Ordering cost per order
H = Holding cost per unit per year
```

**Example**:
```
Annual Demand: 10,000 units
Ordering Cost: $50 per order
Holding Cost: $2 per unit per year

EOQ = √[(2 × 10,000 × $50) ÷ $2]
EOQ = √[1,000,000 ÷ 2]
EOQ = √500,000
EOQ = 707 units per order

Number of Orders: 10,000 ÷ 707 = 14.1 ≈ 14 orders per year

Total Cost:
Ordering: 14 × $50 = $700
Holding: (707÷2) × $2 = $707
Total: $1,407
```

**Reorder Point**:
```
Reorder Point = (Daily Usage × Lead Time) + Safety Stock

Example:
Daily Usage: 50 units
Lead Time: 10 days
Safety Stock: 100 units

Reorder Point: (50 × 10) + 100 = 600 units

When inventory reaches 600 units, place order
```

### Queuing Theory Basics

**Average Wait Time**:
```
Simple formula (single server):
Average Wait = λ ÷ [μ(μ - λ)]

Where:
λ (lambda) = Arrival rate (customers/hour)
μ (mu) = Service rate (customers/hour)
```

**Example**: Bank Teller
```
Customers arrive: 20 per hour (λ = 20)
Teller serves: 25 per hour (μ = 25)

Average Wait: 20 ÷ [25(25-20)]
= 20 ÷ [25 × 5]
= 20 ÷ 125
= 0.16 hours = 9.6 minutes

Average number waiting: λ²÷[μ(μ-λ)]
= 400 ÷ 125 = 3.2 customers

If add second teller, wait time drops significantly
```

### Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis

Beyond simple break-even:

**Multiple Products**:
```
Product    Price   Var Cost   CM    Sales Mix
A          $100    $60        $40   50%
B          $150    $90        $60   30%
C          $200    $140       $60   20%

Weighted Average CM:
= $40(0.5) + $60(0.3) + $60(0.2)
= $20 + $18 + $12 = $50

Fixed Costs: $100,000
Target Profit: $50,000

Required Sales Units:
= ($100,000 + $50,000) ÷ $50
= 3,000 total units

By product:
A: 3,000 × 0.5 = 1,500 units
B: 3,000 × 0.3 = 900 units
C: 3,000 × 0.2 = 600 units
```

**Operating Leverage Factor**:
```
Operating Leverage = Contribution Margin ÷ Net Income

If CM = $200,000 and Net Income = $50,000:
Operating Leverage = $200,000 ÷ $50,000 = 4.0

Interpretation:
10% increase in sales → 40% increase in profit
10% decrease in sales → 40% decrease in profit

Higher leverage = Higher risk and reward
```

## Practical Business Problems

### Problem 1: Pricing Decision

**Scenario**:
Your product costs $45 to make. Competitors sell similar products for $75-$85. You want 35% profit margin.

**Solution**:
```
Cost: $45
Desired Margin: 35%

Price = Cost ÷ (1 - Margin)
Price = $45 ÷ (1 - 0.35)
Price = $45 ÷ 0.65
Price = $69.23

Round to: $69.99

Check:
Profit: $69.99 - $45 = $24.99
Margin: $24.99 ÷ $69.99 = 35.7% ✓
Competitive: Within market range ✓
```

### Problem 2: Staffing Decision

**Scenario**:
Store open 12 hours/day, need minimum 2 staff at all times. Staff work 8-hour shifts at $15/hour. What's monthly labor cost?

**Solution**:
```
Shifts per day: 12 hours ÷ 8 hours = 1.5 shifts per position

Total shift-hours needed: 2 staff × 12 hours = 24 hours/day

Number of 8-hour shifts: 24 ÷ 8 = 3 shifts/day

Daily cost: 3 shifts × 8 hours × $15 = $360
Monthly cost (30 days): $360 × 30 = $10,800
Annual cost: $360 × 365 = $131,400
```

### Problem 3: Expansion Analysis

**Scenario**:
Open new location costing $250,000. Expected to generate $100,000 profit/year for 5 years. Required return 15%. Worth it?

**Solution**:
```
NPV Calculation:
Year 0: -$250,000
Years 1-5: +$100,000 each

PV of cash flows:
Year 1: $100,000 ÷ 1.15 = $86,957
Year 2: $100,000 ÷ 1.3225 = $75,614
Year 3: $100,000 ÷ 1.5209 = $65,752
Year 4: $100,000 ÷ 1.7490 = $57,175
Year 5: $100,000 ÷ 2.0114 = $49,718

Total PV: $335,216
NPV: $335,216 - $250,000 = $85,216

Decision: Yes! Positive NPV of $85,216
Creates value for business
```
