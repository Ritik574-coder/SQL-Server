SQL SYNTAX RULES

1. BASIC STRUCTURE RULES

-   Every SQL statement starts with a keyword (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE,
    DELETE, CREATE, DROP, etc.).
-   Clause order matters in SQL statements.

Correct SELECT order: SELECT column_list FROM table_name WHERE condition
GROUP BY column HAVING condition ORDER BY column;

-   Strings must use single quotes: WHERE name = ‘Ritik’;

-   Aliases can be used with or without AS: SELECT salary AS
    employee_salary FROM employees;

2. CASE SENSITIVITY

-   SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select * from employees;
    SELECT * FROM employees;

-   Table and column case sensitivity depends on the database: MySQL →
    Sometimes PostgreSQL → Yes (if quoted) SQL Server → Usually No
    Oracle → No (unless quoted)

Best practice: - Write SQL keywords in UPPERCASE. - Avoid quoted
identifiers unless necessary.

3. COMMENTS IN SQL

Single-line comment: – This is a comment

Multi-line comment: / This is a multi-line comment /

Comments are ignored by the SQL engine.

4. SQL STATEMENT TYPES

DDL (Data Definition Language) → Defines structure Commands: CREATE,
ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME

DML (Data Manipulation Language) → Manipulates data Commands: SELECT,
INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

DCL (Data Control Language) → Controls permissions Commands: GRANT,
REVOKE

TCL (Transaction Control Language) → Controls transactions Commands:
COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

5. SEMICOLONS AND STATEMENT TERMINATORS

-   Semicolon (;) ends a SQL statement.
-   Some databases require it strictly (PostgreSQL, Oracle).
-   Best practice: Always end statements with a semicolon.

Example: SELECT * FROM employees; SELECT * FROM departments;
